# Documentation Maintenance

We use [JetBrains Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/) tool to add new and maintain existing documentation
for the **Savify** project. You can download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/download) or install it 
through **Jetbrains Toolbox** application.

Follow the [Writerside documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html) to understand 
the basic syntax for **Markdown** files.
